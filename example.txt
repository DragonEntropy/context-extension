Once again, I find myself leaning on the balcony railings, peering down onto the vibrant nightlife of Tokyo. The streets are ablaze with radiant reds and fluorescent yellows, emanating from the flashy neon signs that enchant the countless fried food stalls, cafes and bars that harbour crowds of people enjoying the exuberant atmosphere (couples looking for dinner perhaps? Or individuals looking for some fun?). The pungent scents of fried seafood and noodles waft their way up to the balcony, only to be blown away by the chilling breeze that sweeps across the uppermost floors, dragging the muffled commotion of the streetscape with it, leaving only the whimpers of the wind behind. I feel the cold breeze running through my loose hair. Like a torrent, it thrashes against my skin, dragging me deeper into the silent depths of my apartment. It knows that I’m not from here. It knows that I’m from a place far away. It knows that I’m alone. It was only three months ago that I left Australia. In the days leading to my departure, I was plagued by my parents’ ceaseless attempts to coerce me to stay. “Bianca, you can’t handle studying and working overseas.” “Bianca, you can live a happy life on the farm.” But what they really tried to say was, “Bianca, don’t abandon us like your sister, Rebecca.” As I walked out the door for the last time, our relationship shattered like glassware. The broken fragments etched perpetual scars into my mind. Shutting the balcony door behind me, I cut myself off from the outside, retreating to my bed. The sea of the sheets drags me down, my body suffocating within the mattress. As I lay in the darkness, waves of questions crash against my mind. Were my parents right? Was leaving home a mistake? (I barely talk to anyone, they’re all too different, I always feel so alone and alone and… what would Rebecca…) I cut myself off, as I begin to search for the answer. The day was perfect, with strong sunlight severing the clouds and engulfing the paddock. Rebecca and I were sprawled across the dusty ground, examining a pair of dandelions. Like the paddock’s fenceposts, they unyieldingly stood erected out of the barren soil, withstanding the sunlight’s harshness. Lifting her head to meet my eyes, Rebecca began to speak. “Bianca, what do you want to do after you finish high school?” “Ah… I don’t know. Whatever is best for Mum and Dad.” “Is that what you really want to do?” “I think so…” Rebecca plucked the dandelions out of the ground, placing one into my hands. “Just promise me, you will follow your own dreams.” “Okay…” It was only a few months later that I discovered Rebecca was moving to New York to pursue a law degree. On the day of departure, I watched her wave goodbye as the train stole her away. Her final words were rendered inaudible by the bellowing train, but I knew what she was trying to say. “Remember our promise.” Shibuya, Tokyo I turn the light on and forage through my suitcase. Neglected at the bottom, lies a discoloured glass jar accommodating the dandelion Rebecca gave me. Delicately removing the flower, I observe it. Its stem has withered to a fragile coil, feebly supporting the shrivelled leaves grasping to it. But within it, I see a memory shining brighter than ever. It outshines the rest of the flower. Outshines the room. Outshines the neon lights of Tokyo. Clutching the dandelion, I know that I must press onward, for this is my own dream. Despite our stories diverging, our promise binds us together, beckoning us to overcome our challenges and actualise our dreams. For we order our lives with barely held stories. As if we have been lost in a confusing landscape, gathering what was invisible and unspoken and sewing it all together in order to survive. The balcony door clicks shut behind me, and the apartment exhales the faint smell of cold metal and stale instant coffee. The dandelion’s jar sits on the bedside table like a tiny, stubborn lighthouse: a thing so fragile it should have been long gone, and yet it endures. I touch the glass, feeling the cool rim under my fingertips, and for a moment the apartment is not mine and the neon is not my neighbour — it is a cardboard set of a life I am still rehearsing. Outside, Shibuya never sleeps; down below, the crowd tides and ebbs, drained of their spent laughter and cigarettes, but the neon keeps pretending it is dawn. It has been three months and at times it feels like three years. At other times — when I have a particular slice of loneliness that settles behind my ribs — it feels like three minutes. Time has become elastic. I left Australia because the strain of staying had become louder than my fear of leaving. The glass of our family home had already been cracked; the last thing I wanted was to stand in it any longer and see my reflection multiplied into accusation. Rebecca’s face is the only clear thing I can still hold. When I press my thumb against the dried stem, the memory of her on the dusty ground becomes real, like scent on linen. She was always the wind in my sails, the one who could make complicated things possible, who could wear the city like a new coat and not look a day’s wear down. She left for New York with a grin like she had borrowed the moon. I promised her — and myself — that I would follow my own dream. What I neglected to promise was patience with myself. My days have settled into a rhythm of small things: a train, a small campus with a lecture hall that smells faintly of tatami and ink, a part-time job behind the counter of a tiny café that serves more personality than pastries, and nights on the balcony where I stare at neon constellations and count how many strangers laugh in a night. People assume it takes bravery to move continents. The truth tastes more complicated: hope wrapped in anxiety, courage perhaps, but also practical boredom, the grind of learning a city’s map, the muscle ache of carrying a suitcase that begins to belong to you. On my fifth week, I found myself standing in front of a squat café wedged between an izakaya and a second-hand camera shop. Its sign was a faded hand-painted teacup and under it, in small English letters, “Kimi’s.” I needed a job. I needed rent money. Mostly, I needed a place where my fingers could learn a new rhythm — making coffee felt like learning a new language. Kimi was older than me by at least twenty years and had the calm, efficient air of someone who had been surprised often, and stopped being surprised at the right time. She had a scar along her knuckle like a punctuation mark on a life. Her English was stitched from confidence and kindness, and for the first shift she spoke slowly, with patient vowels that made me feel like I was learning the shape of a word I could carry. “You make the matcha like this,” she said. “First warm the bowl. Feel its weight.” She taught me how to tamp, the way to watch the crema settle like a small landscape. She taught me how to smile at people even when they were a little lost, and how to ask questions where questions were needed. The café became a rehearsal room for my life. There were days when I could be seen moving through the espresso machine like a mariner trusting his compass: both hands occupied, both ears open. There were afternoons when tourists, their faces warm with the day’s plan, sat at the window and asked me — in their halting English or in my still imperfect Japanese — where I was from. “Australia,” I would say, and then the conversation would unspool: the beaches that smelled like gum trees, the black soil of the farm, the flat light on the paddock. On such days the stories would spill out of me like sugar crystals; strangers would nod, and sometimes other staff would laugh, and for a while I would be entirely visible and entirely alive. One regular customer was an older man named Hiroshi, who came in almost every morning for a thick black coffee. He read the same crumpled newspaper and took precisely three sips before he would set it down and look at me. He had a habit of leaving a single coin on the table when he thought the café was particularly busy, a small offering to whatever benevolence ran the day. His hair was the colour of iron; his fingers bore the map of decades working with their hands. He never pried but he observed, that quiet kind of observation that people who have lived long enough give off like a scent. Once, when the rain had been impatient with the city, he sat opposite me and said, “You carry the wind from far away.” I laughed and he offered me no explanation. Instead he recommended a book, slid under a napkin: a thin volume of essays by an author I had never heard of. “Read when you have time,” he said. “It will tell you things you already know.” On the other brink of my days, lectures unfolded. I enrolled in a communications program, believing — perhaps naively — that words were the best way to stitch my experience into something that made sense to anyone else, and to myself. The classroom was a mosaic of accents and anxieties: salarymen returning for a promotion, bright students from Osaka, a girl who wore gloves because she liked the way they made her hands look like props in an old movie. I watched your world through vague analogies; through other people’s words I learned how much of my life was a script I had not written. The loneliness never left entirely. It would arrive uninvited, an old friend slipping into the booth beside me and humming a song I could not recall. At night it sat with me, asking me dangerous questions: Had I abandoned my family? Had I betrayed them? Or had I simply been honest for once? I would press my forehead against the cold glass of the balcony and let the neon reflect in my eyeballs like broken currency. Once, the loneliness collected a voice — not my inner monologue, but an externalized version of my parents’ warnings — and it became almost unbearable. I would replay the last argument with my mother, the way her voice had folded and overlapped with my father’s like a creased map that could no longer be smoothed. But then there were moments where small bridges were built. A classmate named Mei — bright teeth, bright scarf — offered to show me where to get cheap stationery and recommended a tiny gallery in Harajuku where local artists sold prints that smelled faintly of paint and possibility. Mei’s English was better than her confidence; she apologised for laughing at her own jokes. We would trade skills: she would teach me idioms that could make my Japanese sound less like a literal translation, and I would tell her about the astrophysicist aunt she had never met but always wanted to email. Mei’s presence was the nearest thing I had to a hometown. The city itself became a teacher. On rainy Tuesdays I would get lost near the Sumida River, and the river would teach me to move without the map in my hand. I learned to notice the way light falls on subway tiles, how trains have their own rhythm of sighs and acceleration. I discovered a second-hand bookshop near Koenji that smelled of dust and mahogany where the proprietor — elderly, with spectacles that magnified his eyes like moons — would wrap the books in brown paper and tie each with twine with the reverence of ritual. I spent hours in his shop; once he let me read in a corner and didn’t mind when I fell asleep. I woke to him making me tea and telling me I looked more relaxed than when I had arrived. Then there were nights with a friend I hadn’t expected to find: Tom, an Australian expat who’d been in Tokyo three years longer than me and had become, for reasons he never explained, a kind of unofficial ambassador for the city. He knew where to get the best ramen at three in the morning and how to navigate the bureaucracy with minimal paperwork. He liked to joke that he had mastered survival here by learning the art of smiling and saying nothing. We would walk through neon avenues and he would point out subtleties of the city as if reading a book to me: the way the older women in small neighbourhoods hung laundry like flags, claiming their small territories in the air; the way a vending machine could have an elegance all its own, buttoned up in aluminium and warmth. Tom’s accent was tied to a history of fires and barbecues and long afternoons; sometimes, in the hum of his voice, I could hear my own accent reflected and feel less invisible. But it was a letter from Rebecca that peeled away the last layer of some long-term numbness. She didn’t send it digitally. I don’t know why she chose paper — maybe the slow friction of post is important to some people — but my name on the envelope was written in her tidy script. I must have read that letter a dozen times on the balcony, the paper folded and refolded until the creases became as familiar as the lines on my palm. Rebecca told me about a courthouse in downtown Manhattan and a library she loved that smelled of lemon oil and old leather. She told me about arguments with professors, about the adrenaline of winning a small trial she had helped prepare, and about a woman she’d met who played jazz on a Tuesday night. “We are doing different kinds of brave,” she wrote. “But bravery is still bravery. Don’t compare the scale of ours. Measure by the size of the leap in your chest.” She also told me — simply and quietly — that she missed me. The words were lightly underlined. She asked about the dandelion jar, and I could see her imagining it on my bedside table, catching the light. She signed off with a crude little drawing — two stick figures holding hands, one with a small circle at the shoulder that was perhaps a scarf. “Keep going,” she wrote. “Come visit if you can. Or I’ll come the day I get a break.” I cried, which surprised me not because of the tears but because they were gentle and not fevered. They answered a kind of thirst I hadn’t sensed. I answered her with a photo: the dandelion jar, the balcony, me with a ridiculous hat I had bought that week. I told her about Kimi’s café, about the bookshop, about how much I liked matching chopsticks to cups of matcha like a costume designer matching outfits to actors. She replied, as Rebecca always did, with a sentence that reduced me to a small, tender thing: “I always knew you would be good at making small worlds.” Small worlds had become my métier. I started to notice the architecture of life in the same way Kimi taught me to watch crema form: small tensions, delicate balances, the slow engineering of somebody’s happiness. Little rituals built scaffolding for me. I would write a list each morning — not of accomplishments but of moments I wanted to notice: “1. Smell of the shop’s beans. 2. Laugh of the woman in the red coat. 3. Moment when a customer blushes when their partner pays.” The list felt childish at first, but over time it was like a muscle training me to catch the things that make life somewhere worth living. There were setbacks. Once, a bureaucratic error threatened my residency status. I sat in an interminable office under fluorescent lights, with a woman behind the counter who barely blinked as she told me I needed a document my parents had to sign. I called home and heard my mother’s voice, cautious and sharp. She was softer when she heard there was a problem — as if the news had reanimated her protective instincts — but that same tone came with a cautiousness I could no longer parse. I tried to explain everything: the deadlines, the forms, the necessity of signatures. She offered to send the papers. I offered to pay for the mail. The conversation folded into a pause that stretched like an elastic band. “Why did you leave?” she asked finally. “For me,” I said. “To see if I could be something else.” There was silence, then the familiar rustle of our patched lives. “We miss you,” she said. “But if you are happy, then that is all we want. Just promise you take care.” I promised. The truth felt thin, like a veil. Being away from home meant I could not interpret the small inflections that my parents used when they said things in a language that had once been ours alone. It meant I had to make new translations without the easy cheat of childhood. But it also meant that I had to take the initiative: I mailed documents back and forth; I learned how to place a phone call that cut across oceans and permissions; I learned the art of patience with a foreign postal system. For the first time I felt like I was building adult scaffolding under my feet. Work at the café changed too. Kimi trusted me with the till. “You can manage the rush,” she said with the kind of faith that can flatten or lift you. Once, during a summer night, a group of university kids came in laughing, and one of them — a young woman with a camera’s strap around her neck — dropped her wallet. I handed it back and she laughed, and then she sat with me and asked about Australia and the farm. She was dizzy with the feeling that another continent was a story, and she had the appetite to collect narratives like postcards. The café was full of small thefts of attention like that. People would leave stories in the sugar jar with a napkin. Sometimes they left sketches. I started to sketch myself, too. Not proper art, more like a habit of noticing faces in the steam of a cup. I bought a cheap notebook and inked small pages of observations: a man with a coin from Okinawa, a woman with a faded band tee who kept to herself, a boy who sketched the city while trying to remain invisible. The act of drawing gave me the sensation of attaching a label not to a thing but to the feeling it made in me. Shapes became sentences. One evening, a week after Rebecca’s letter, Mei invited me to a small gallery opening. It was a cramped room with high ceilings and the smell of wet paint. Young artists stood under their works like shepherds with their flocks. One piece stopped me: it was a large canvas of an empty paddock, your standard Aussie horizon, painted in a way that felt like both homage and interrogation. I recognised the way the light hit the grass. When I stared the painting down I wanted to sob, but I felt as if the sobbing would be a kind of translation I had yet to learn. An artist — thin, hair in an unruly black coil, smiling as if they had memorised their own life — caught my eye. “You look like you know that fence,” they said. “It’s a good fence,” I replied, and laughed at my own ridiculousness. We spoke about distance and home and why those concepts had become like luggage you lug around unwillingly. The artist, whose name was Sora, asked if I would tell them about my paddock. We sat under the painting and I did — not the whole story but the parts that were relevant: the sun on the fenceposts, the dandelion, the conversation with Rebecca. “You should paint it,” Sora said. “Paint what pulls you back; paint what scares you.” I didn’t consider myself an artist. But Sora’s words felt like an invitation written in the margins of a life. I borrowed an easel from the gallery for the weekend and went to a small studio space that Sora recommended. I had no idea where to begin. I laid down a wash of ochre and a strip of cobalt for the sky, and at first it was an ugly thing, an amateur’s map. But as the paint dried, the lines took on a meaning I hadn’t known I was storing. The fenceposts became not just objects but punctuation marks: pauses that marked the end of a sentence and the start of another. When I stood back, something inside me had shifted: the act of making was less about producing a thing than about making a space in which the thing could be spoken. I sent a photo of the painting to Rebecca. Her reply was immediate and ecstatic, and what she wrote balanced pride with a kind of pragmatic tenderness: “Make the painting for me,” she said. “And for you. Send it when it’s ready.” There are people who can encourage and also add a tether. Rebecca was both. A few months into my stay, I stumbled into something that felt like a turning point. Kimi’s café had a small notice board where local events were pinned with thumbtacks like small flags. One afternoon I spied a flyer for an open-mic night in a tiny basement venue near my university — poetry, music, story. I had always been a person of private declarations, not public ones, but the flyer called to me with the same stubbornness as the dandelion. I filled a paper cup with coffee and sat on the balcony to decide whether to go. The balcony’s neon glow pooled on my thigh. My dandelion’s stem caught the light and threw a tiny star across the wall. I went. I sat in the back with a notebook and watched the room like it was an animal I had to earn the right to speak to. People performed in hushed reverence; their confessions were like wisps of smoke. There was a woman who sang about the sea, whose voice kept catching like netting in the wind; there was a man who read a monologue about a lost bicycle. I had nothing planned. I had only a memory of Rebecca as a small compass and the painting of the paddock drying in a corner of my rented studio, and the knowledge that promises are promises not because they are kept but because we return to them. When my name came up — and it did because someone in the crowd nudged the host — I stepped up to the small stage with my notebook like an offering. My hands trembled, but not from fear; from the prickle of being seen. I read. I read the story of the dandelion and the paddock and of Rebecca’s smile, of leaving and the sound the train made when it took her away, of the promise and the shape of it like a small, imperfect compass. I read about the night two weeks earlier when I had sat on the balcony and watched a boy trail his hand along the railing like he was testing the city for seams. People listened. They made that small, old noises that mean someone is following the path of your words. When I finished I didn’t know what to expect. The man in the first row — a sculptor, he said — stood up and applauded, not just politely but like someone who had been touched. Afterwards, under fluorescent alleyway light, someone — a girl with a freckled nose — asked me if I had ever considered writing more. “You should,” she said. “We have a zine. We’d love to print this.” Her enthusiasm was merciless and tender. I went home and placed my head on the pillow and felt like I had set down a heavy bag and found more room in my arms. It was a small validation, but it mattered. That winter, the city showed me another way of belonging. I was invited by a professor to give a small talk at a symposium about cultural narratives. It was my first time speaking in a formal setting and my voice did its usual trick of moving between trembling and steady. I spoke about home as a palimpsest: layers of stories written over each other, subject to erasure and re-inscription. I talked about the dandelion, about how a faded object could hold a promise like an anchor. Afterward, an older woman — a visiting scholar — pulled me aside. “Your voice is honest,” she said. “We like honest voices.” She asked how an Australian girl came to study in Tokyo and, over the course of tea and too-sweet cake, she told me about a project exploring migrant narratives. It was the sort of serendipity that arrived at moments when you were least prepared. She offered me a small assistantship, nothing monumental, but it meant that I would have resources to travel domestically and to interview people who had moved cities and worlds. The assistantship changed me because it formalised my curiosity. It made my habit of noticing into work. I started to record interviews — not formal, but conversations at a bookshelf in a quiet library, on the train, at the café counter. People told me about their migrations: a Pakistani woman who had arrived with one suitcase and an old recipe book that smelled like coriander; a Filipina nurse who told me how the night shift had become her friend; a young man from Kyoto who had come to Tokyo to chase music. These stories stitched themselves into my own, and in their listening I found the architecture of compassion. I learned to accept small failures too. My painting of the paddock did not sell at the gallery. I had believed, foolishly, that I could trade my homesickness for money. The gallery’s curator — diplomatic, gentle — told me that the piece needed more time. “It is tender,” she said, “and tender work takes longer to breathe.” I took it back to my studio and worked on it again, and again. Each iteration was a conversation between my hands and my memory — a negotiation about which details could be made public and which had to remain sacred. Spring arrived and with it the festival season. The streets were suddenly full of lanterns, and the smell of yakitori competed with festival sweets. Mei and I wandered through stalls and ate candied fruit and laughed at our inability to properly use chopsticks on skewered mochi. Tom introduced me to a small circle of friends who were, like him, Australians who had arrived in their twenties and had chosen to stay. They shared their strategies: book exchanges, where to find cheap flights home, the names of doctors who took expat insurance. Their stories were a collage of practicalities and dreams. We spent long nights talking under the low hum of a restaurant’s heater, and I formed furtive plans: visit New York; visit Rebecca; show her the paddock painting as if it were proof that I had carried the promise through. In late spring, something happened that I hadn’t been certain I wanted: my parents came to visit. They arrived with overpacked suitcases and an awkwardness like two people stepping into a language that had changed. The airport meeting was clumsy: hugs that were a fraction too long, smiles that cracked before they settled. The first morning we shared coffee in the tiny kitchen of my apartment — their faces puffy from travel and jet lag — and I watched as they scanned the bookshelf as if trying to read me in the titles. We spoke haltingly, as if each sentence needed to be cut and stitched again. My mother wept when she saw the dandelion jar. She held it in her hands like it was a relic and then looked up at me as if to gauge whether the relic had become an altar or a museum piece. “It looks small,” she said, meaning tenderness and disappointment at the same time. Behind her eyes there was an expression that was part scepticism, part relief. They took a pilgrimage to the gallery where my painting was displayed. My father — who had never been good with art — stood in front of the canvas and asked, earnestly, “Is this you?” The question was more tender than critical. “I don’t know,” I said. “Maybe. It’s what I see when I think of home.” They stayed for a week and we did the tourist loop in our own way: a shrine, a museum, a ramen place that boasted a ten-minute wait and the best broth in the neighbourhood. We talked about trivialities — the state of the tomatoes back home; the way the dog had become picky — and about serious things: how much rent was, whether I was saving, whether I had plans. There were still hard sentences: my mother took me by the hand one afternoon and asked if I had friends that would catch me when my resolve faded. I said yes, and tried to say the truth: that sometimes I felt unglued but that other times the city made me feel like a person who had learned how to hold fire without burning herself. On their last night, we sat on my balcony and watched the city make its slow promises. We drank cheap wine from disposable cups and spoke of the future like it was a map we were drawing together. There was a tentative peace that came with physical proximity; perhaps people don’t always need to resolve everything in a week. Maybe the act of seeing is its own kind of reconciliation. My father patted my shoulder and said, “We are proud of you.” He did not, as my mother might have feared, tell me to come home. He did not try to reclaim me. He simply held out a piece of apple and told me how the orchard had fared that year. The pastoral details patched up a fabric of connection I had not known how to mend. When they left, I was both relieved and sated. The apartment felt fuller, sweeter somehow, and I had the buoyant memory of my mother’s laugh reverberating in the kitchen. I sent them with care packages: Japanese teas, a small painting I had finished in a flurried burst of productivity, and a promise: I would come home for Christmas. It was around then that I got the email that made me stop: a short, formal note from a small press that had seen my open-mic work and wanted me to write a short piece on migration and memory for their next issue. It was small remunerative work and, more importantly, it was validation that my small voice was not only being heard but valued. I wrote like someone who had been tapping letters into water and suddenly found they had an audience. The piece was about the dandelion, about how small things refuse to die, about the strange constellation of obligations that tether you to one place while your own dream tugs you elsewhere. I wrote about my mother’s hands and the train that took Rebecca away, about the fenceposts and the way a painting can be a way to send a letter home. The press published the piece with a modest photograph of the dandelion jar. It sold a few copies and a stranger contacted me to say that my words had reminded them of leaving their own home for the first time. “It’s funny how an old thing can feel like a new coin,” she wrote. My inbox was small but it warmed like a stove. The proof that words could reach someone else — that my story could be a bridge — felt like the most significant thing I had yet experienced. Summer began to percolate through the city like slow tea. The lights at night seemed less frantic and more celebratory. Mei and I did a weekend trip to the coast and stretched our legs on a beach that smelled like salt and distant eucalyptus. I walked along the shore, picked up a stone like a talisman, and thought about where I had been and where I might go. Rebecca called that night from New York in a cadence that suggested she had been running between classes and a small court appearance. She laughed, and when she asked about the painting I sent her a photograph. “It’s yours,” she said. “You can keep this one for now. Maybe one day I’ll come stand next to that fence and get to see it in real life.” “Come visit,” I said, and I meant it. When the year marked its small anniversary, I found myself standing again on the balcony. The dandelion jar caught the light like it had always done. The city below hummed. I realised I had not answered one of the most stubborn questions that had kept me awake in my early nights here: had I made a mistake leaving? I thought of the cracked relationship with my parents and the stitches we had started laying down. I thought of Rebecca’s promise and the fact that promises tend to be living things. I thought of Kimi’s patience and Hiroshi’s coin. I had come to Tokyo not to outrun anything but to become someone who could choose. The city had taught me practicalities and given me friends and a job and a painting. It had also taught me that belonging is not a location; it is an activity. I can be bound to my parents and still be an inhabitant of Tokyo. I can hold the paddock in my teeth and still buy a train ticket to an exhibition. The choices were no longer framed as absolutes but as continuities. A month later I received another letter from the press: they wanted to commission a longer piece and offered me a small stipend. It would require interviews and research, travel and time. It would also mean that my writing could be more than a hobby. I accepted. Space grew in my days to think and breathe. I spent hours compiling stories, transcribing interviews, painting and revising. I visited markets and elderly neighbours and people who had crossed continents for love, for work, for study. Each person’s story was a thread, and as I wove them together I found that my own thread — the dandelion, the promise to Rebecca — was not a single, heroic narrative but a part of a larger tapestry. There was a certain humility in that knowledge. My life had not become grand, but it had become more honest. There came, too, a moment where I finally invited my parents to come again — not as visitors but as collaborators. I asked them to write a small piece for the zine the open-mic girl had asked me to contribute to. My mother, at first cautious, agreed. She wrote a short anecdote about a recipe that had been passed down through generations and how the scent of it could make her feel like a child again. My father sent a photograph of the orchard with a note about the particular light that fell there in August. When the zine came out, they were both ridiculous with pride. The act of sending fragments of home into my city made me feel less divided. There were nights when I still stood on the balcony and felt like a fraud. On those nights, I would take the dandelion jar and set it on my palm and whisper its name: promise. I imagined the small plant as a bridge that could survive a thousand small storms. Rebecca called less often now; both of us were busy. But when we did talk there was an ease to it, like two people who had weathered storms and now had maps where none existed. I am not naive enough to claim that everything is solved. There are still arguments with my parents in that thin thread where love and disappointment overlap. There are still nights where the city feels too loud and my shoulders pull up and the ache of being away translates into physical grief. There are times when I want to pack a bag and return to a life that has fewer trains and more certainty. But in the past year I have learned to steward my own small compass. Sometimes the smallest things change you. I remember one morning when Kimi handed me a small cup of tea and said, “You know, the dandelion will never be as fresh as it was. But a memory can be as alive as you choose.” I thought she meant the flower, but she meant me. The dandelion’s dried stem is not failure; it is evidence of a promise kept. It is proof that a small thing can carry the weight of intention across months and miles. On an unremarkable Tuesday — the kind of day that hides monumental shifts under mundane ordinariness — I found myself listing things that had shifted in me: a steadier hand in the espresso machine, an ink stain on my notebook from a midnight of feverish writing, friends who had become family, the dandelion jar that now sat alongside a new painting of the city’s river. I realised I had become an intersection: of two continents, of my parents’ voices and my sister’s laughter, of an old paddock and a metropolitan skyline. I still don’t know everything. I still wake up sometimes with a hollow throat. But I can now carry the hollowness and continue. The promise to Rebecca is no longer a chain binding me to a single path; it is a compass that points me to the north of my own intention. I understand now that promises can be revised kindly — that following your own dream does not necessarily mean abandoning the ones you love. Instead, following your dream often means bringing those you love along in ways they will accept. It means letting people sit with different maps and still feel close enough to reach out and touch. There will be more paintings and more essays and a thousand small coffees to pull. There will be more phone calls and paperwork and miscommunications and reconciliations. There will be moments when the dandelion’s thin stem looks like it might snap under pressure and other moments when it seems to pulse with stubborn life. I have learned to be gentle with myself in both situations. I have learned to make small worlds and to invite others into them; I have learned that sometimes a small world can be wild and large enough to carry the whole ocean’s worth of longing. One evening in autumn, with the city moving in a soft, rust-coloured sweep, Rebecca arrived. She stepped out of a taxi with a suitcase and that same quick, nervous grin I had known since we were small. We stood in the doorway like two actors reentering a scene we had both rehearsed a thousand times in our heads. We did not speak at first; we simply held each other, and all the months of letters and calls and promises folded into that hug like the pages of a book. We spent that week doing things that mapped our diverging lives back together: we visited the gallery and stood in front of the paddock painting; we drank coffee at Kimi’s; we walked through the festival and argued about the best way to eat candied fruit on a stick. There was laughter and there were tears and a conversation that finally made sense of things that had been left unsaid. Rebecca looked at the painting, then at me. “You kept our promise,” she said. “No,” I answered. “We kept it. But mostly — I kept a version of mine.” She nodded. Her eyes were bright with that fierce light of hers. “Good,” she said. “Because I think promises change when you live them. They get better.” We stood on my balcony on the last night of her visit. The neon hummed below, and the dandelion jar sat like a small monument to our childish oath. Rebecca took a photograph of the jar and then — without a given reason, as if obeying a sudden impulse — she placed her palm over mine and held it there. We did not need to say anything. The city spoke for us, in its relentless way, as if to say that belonging is not a single address but a practice you cultivate: small visits, shared meals, letters left in mailboxes. She left again for New York after a week. We watched the train carry her away, and this time the goodbye was folded with the knowledge that it would not be permanent. We had made a new map: not one of absolute control but of agreements and visits and small gifts. The dandelion jar caught the last light of the evening and threw it into our hands. A year has passed since I first stepped onto that balcony and felt the cold bite of the city. I have been both braver and more tender than I expected. The city has taught me how to mend myself in small stitches, how to ask for help and how to be patient when help requires time. I have learned the art of accumulation: that small joys are the currency of life. I have learned how to call home not as a way to lubricate the past but to weave the past into an ongoing present. Sometimes I still dream of the farm: the smell of soil, my father’s large hands, Rebecca’s laugh as the train carried her away. Sometimes I dream about the neon streets, the coffee’s crema, the way an alley could open into a festival. Both dreams are true; neither cancels the other. I am the sum of both places now. There is no neat moral here, no tidy solution I can pin to a wall and admire. There is only the continued work of waking up each day and making a small list: “1. Make coffee. 2. Write. 3. Notice.” In those little tasks I have found the architecture of belonging. The dandelion sits in its jar, not proud but persistent, proof that a promise, once made, can be more than memory: it can be a practice. I step away from the balcony now and look at the painting by the window: the fenceposts, the dirt, the sky. I run my thumb along the edge of the canvas and think of how far a thin stem can travel if you tend it. The city hums, far and near, and somewhere across the ocean a train whistles. I smile, and it lands like a small coin in my hand — no bank, no authority, but it buys me the right to keep going. Bianca.
